# Journey map examples

In order to have a journey we will need at least three pages that will link together

We will add two pages so that we will have a page at each of the following:
- home page: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- question page: [http://localhost:3000/question](http://localhost:3000/question)
- completed page: [http://localhost:3000/completed](http://localhost:3000/completed)

The following examples will build on the [front end examples](../front-end-examples/README.md) and eventually make use of the [@envage/hapi-govuk-journey-map](https://github.com/DEFRA/hapi-govuk-journey-map) plugin to provide a simple way to configure the journey between the web pages served from a hapi server.
